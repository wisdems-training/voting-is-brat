				<li>	you need to show proof of residence. you can use almost anything that has your full name and your address you’re register at: a driver’s license, state id, utility bill, pay stub, banking or credit card statement, etc. you can also use a residential lease, but if you do you will have to register in person at your municipal clerk’s office or a government office like the dmv or a library.	</li>
				<li>	you can show proof of residence docs on your phone when you register. pro tip: update your address on your mobile banking app and show a credit or banking statement to register	</li>
				<li>	your student id card works to register <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">only</span> if it has: the date the card was issued, your signature, and an expiration date no later than 2 years after when it was issued. you will also need to show a tuition/fee statement that has your school address on it. you can update your fee statement to show the correct address in your school’s portal then show it on your phone.
				<p style="font-style: italic;">   *we think that’s really complicated too; it might be easier to just use a state id or utility bill as proof of residence.</p></li>
